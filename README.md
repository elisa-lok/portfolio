# Portfolio Website

This project was bootstrapped with ReactJS.

### Project Introduction: 

This project was created to highlight my skills and experience as a software developer. It features sections that provide an introduction about me, an overview of my professional journey, a detailed showcase of my skills, my projects, and ways to get in touch. The website is fully responsive and optimized for various devices. Additionally, I integrated the EmailJS SDK, allowing visitors to send emails directly to me, enabling me to respond effectively.
